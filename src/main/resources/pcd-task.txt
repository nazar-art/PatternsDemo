         abstract factory
         factory method          239, 414, 446, 666
         template method         264, 408, 475, 616, 696, 842, 919, 923
         proxy                   422
         state                   214

         composite
      +  decorator               512

   •  UML diagrams(class && sequence) should be created for each pattern;
   •  Use your own implementation, do not copy-paste from inet
